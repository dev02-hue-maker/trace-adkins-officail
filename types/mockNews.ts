    excerpt: '"Adkins Reserve" premium small-batch bourbon now available in select markets.',
    content: `
      <p>Trace Adkins has partnered with the historic Buffalo Trace Distillery to launch "Adkins Reserve," a premium small-batch bourbon that reflects his Louisiana roots and love for authentic American craftsmanship. The bourbon debuted in select markets this week to rave reviews from spirits critics.</p>
      
      <p>"I've been a bourbon fan my whole life," Adkins said during the launch event in Louisville, Kentucky. "Working with Buffalo Trace to create something that represents my taste and my story has been an incredible experience. This isn't just another celebrity endorsement - I was hands-on throughout the entire process."</p>
      
      <h3>Bourbon Specifications:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Name: Adkins Reserve Small Batch Bourbon</li>
        <li>Proof: 90 (45% ABV)</li>
        <li>Aging: 6 years in new American oak barrels</li>
        <li>Tasting Notes: Caramel, vanilla, oak, with hints of pecan and spice</li>
        <li>MSRP: $49.99</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Adkins was involved in every aspect of the bourbon's development, from selecting the mash bill (70% corn, 20% rye, 10% malted barley) to determining the aging process and final proof. The bourbon is aged in Buffalo Trace's legendary Warehouse C, known for producing some of the distillery's most acclaimed expressions.</p>
      
      <p>"Trace brought a genuine passion and knowledge to the project," said Buffalo Trace master distiller Harlen Wheatley. "He didn't just want his name on a bottle - he wanted to create a bourbon that whiskey enthusiasts would appreciate and enjoy."</p>
      
      <p>Initial distribution is limited to Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, Texas, and California, with plans to expand to additional states throughout 2023. A portion of proceeds from each bottle sold will benefit the Wounded Warrior Project, an organization Adkins has supported for over a decade.</p>
      
      <p>The bottle design features Adkins' signature on the front label and coordinates to his hometown of Sarepta, Louisiana on the back. Limited edition gift sets including two Glencairn glasses will be available for the holiday season.</p>
